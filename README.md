Proof of Location Protocol(POLP) is the first decentralized protocol that enhances privacy in location services across Web3 ecosystems. Utilizing state-of-the-art Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), POLP ensures that users can share and verify their geographical positions without exposing actual data, making it an ideal solution for privacy-conscious applications on blockchain platforms.
